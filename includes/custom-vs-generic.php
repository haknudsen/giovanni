                        <p>At Talking Heads<sup class="tm ">&#174;</sup> we don't ask you to fill out a lame generic survey and we don't use freelance writers. We listen to you, ask you lots of
                        questions and listen some more and then when we're on the same page and headed in the right direction we collaborate with you live over Google Docs to create a custom script
                        using powerful words to engage and motivate your viewers to take action. Say no to surveys and companies that won't spend a lot of time to talk to you.</p>
